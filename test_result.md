      message: "✅ ALL OPEN BANKING API TESTS PASSED! Successfully tested all 3 requested Open Banking endpoints with JWT authentication. The connect-accounts endpoint returns proper dashboard format, accounts endpoint returns detailed account information with JoPACC structure, and dashboard endpoint provides aggregated data. Sandbox mode is working correctly with 3 mock bank accounts showing realistic balance information. All endpoints properly require authentication and handle invalid tokens correctly. The implementation follows the expected response formats and includes proper balance calculations."
