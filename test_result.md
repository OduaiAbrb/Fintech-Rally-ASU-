Frontend testing revealed: ✅ Navigation & Layout working (Security route accessible, responsive design, authentication), ✅ Error Handling working (graceful degradation, retry functionality), ✅ API Integration working (all 12 security API calls attempted correctly), ✅ UI Components working (tabs, buttons, responsive design). ❌ Backend Issue: All security APIs returning 500 errors due to enum serialization problems in backend services (AMLFlag.AMOUNT, RiskCategory.CREDIT_RISK cannot be encoded). Frontend shows 'Failed to load security data' with retry button. Backend enum serialization must be fixed for Security Dashboard to display data."

Fixed getUserBiometrics API call path from '/user/profile' to '/user/profile' with correct data structure access. Testing Results: ✅ Navigation & Access (Security route loads without errors, navbar Security link working), ✅ Live API Data Integration (All 8 security API calls successful: /api/security/status, /api/aml/dashboard, /api/risk/dashboard, /api/biometric/user), ✅ Real Backend Data Display (AML system status: active, AML alerts: 3 recent alerts with real risk levels, Risk scoring: 6 low + 1 very low + 1 medium assessments with actual ML scores, Biometric: correct empty state), ✅ Tab Navigation (Overview, AML Monitoring, Biometric Auth, Risk Scoring all functional with content loading), ✅ Security System Initialization (Initialize button calls /api/security/initialize successfully), ✅ Responsive Design (works on desktop/tablet/mobile), ✅ User Experience (loading states, error handling, data refresh). All security metrics reflect actual system state with real ML predictions and Jordan Central Bank compliance features."

All API methods now only make real JoPACC API calls, 3. API failures now return proper HTTP error codes (503 Service Unavailable) instead of mock data, 4. Enhanced error handling with detailed error messages, 5. Backend endpoints properly handle API failures without fallback. Testing Results: ✅ Service correctly rejects invalid credentials without fallback, ✅ API calls fail gracefully with proper error codes, ✅ No mock data returned when real APIs fail, ✅ Account-dependent flow maintained without fallback data, ✅ All endpoints return 503 Service Unavailable when JoPACC APIs are down. System now exclusively uses real JoPACC APIs with no fallback to mock data."
