The AI engineer successfully built a stablecoin-based fintech platform from an MVP, iteratively adding complex features. Initially, core wallet functionalities and a basic AI concierge were established. Subsequent phases focused on comprehensive JoPACC Open Banking integration (accounts, balances, FX) and a user profile page. Significant work involved migrating from mocked to real JoPACC APIs, which required multiple rounds of debugging for endpoint URLs, header formats, and credential management, including resolving an OAuth2 conflict. The engineer then implemented an enterprise-grade security suite, incorporating ML-based AML monitoring and risk scoring, and developing a corresponding frontend dashboard. User-to-user transfers were also added. Most recently, the engineer troubleshot a local deployment login issue, identifying and fixing a misconfigured frontend backend URL and an ESLint error. The current task involves restructuring Open Banking API calls to ensure dependency on  and proper  header integration, using provided customer data.

The goal is to develop a multi-purpose fintech platform centered around a Jordanian Dinar (JD)â€“pegged stablecoin, integrating open banking APIs from Jordan Open Finance (JoPACC). The platform aims to provide:
1.  **Stablecoin Wallet & Stored Value Card**: For JD-pegged stablecoin, enabling fiat-stablecoin exchange, and unified payments.
2.  **Open Banking Integration (JoPACC)**: Account Information Services (AIS), Payment Initiation Services (PIS), Financial Product Services (FPS), and Foreign Exchange (FX). This includes making all API calls dependent on  and adding  to headers, handling various customer account structures (single, multiple, custodian accounts for individual, corporate, and business customers).
3.  **Enhanced Security & Anti-Fraud**: AML monitoring (ML-based, Jordan Central Bank compliant), biometric security (currently disabled), and robust risk scoring (ML-based).
4.  **AI-Powered Money Concierge (Hey Dinar)**: A conversational assistant integrated with financial data.
5.  **International Transactions**: Facilitate low-fee, near-instant global remittances.
6.  **User Profiling & Credit Scoring**: Aggregate open banking data for comprehensive financial profiles.
7.  **Micro Loans**: Provide quick access to small loans with AI-powered approval and flexible management.
8.  **IBAN Verification**: Integrate IBAN verification during user registration.

The implementation progressed from basic MVP (wallet, UI, JWT auth) to integrating real JoPACC APIs, user profiles, advanced security (AML, risk scoring), user-to-user transfers, and now requires specific enhancements to the JoPACC integration logic and the addition of micro-loan features.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical local deployment issue related to user login and frontend-backend communication, and then provided a comprehensive list of internal APIs and a detailed user experience workflow which was further enhanced to include micro loans and IBAN verification.

**Login/Deployment Issue Resolution:**
The primary issue was that users could not sign in locally.
-   **Problem 1 (Frontend URL Misconfiguration)**: The  in  was incorrectly pointing to an external preview URL () instead of the local backend URL ().
-   **Fix 1**: The AI engineer edited  to set .
-   **Problem 2 (ESLint Error)**: The  file had an ESLint error () due to direct use of  and .
-   **Fix 2**: The AI engineer edited  to change  to  and  to  within the  function.
-   **Verification**: After restarting the frontend, the login process became fully functional locally, confirming that backend authentication was always working and the issues were solely frontend-related configuration and minor code errors.

**OAuth2 Transfer Error Resolution:**
-   **Problem**: Transfers failed with a '404 No such object: oauth2%2ftoken' error, indicating a problem with JoPACC's OAuth2 authentication.
-   **Fix**: The AI engineer identified that  had conflicting authentication methods (one using OAuth2, one using direct token from environment variables). The failing OAuth2 method () and its calls were removed. The  method was updated to exclusively use direct token authentication from environment variables (, , etc.). Duplicate methods were also removed.
-   **Verification**: Transfer functionality was successfully tested and confirmed working without the OAuth2 error.

**Current State of the Product:**
The platform is fully operational locally, with:
-   **User Authentication**: Robust login/signup.
-   **Stablecoin Wallet**: Deposit, exchange between JD and stablecoin, and transaction history.
-   **Open Banking**: Real JoPACC API integration for accounts, balances, and FX rates, with fallback to mock data when JoPACC APIs don't return specific test data. Linked accounts displayed on both Open Banking and User Profile pages.
-   **AI Money Concierge (Hey Dinar)**: A rule-based chat assistant.
-   **User Profile**: Displays comprehensive user financial information, live FX rates from real JoPACC APIs, and the ability to initiate transfers from bank accounts to the JD wallet.
-   **User-to-User Transfers**: Full P2P transfer system with user search and AML monitoring integration.
-   **Security Dashboard**: Frontend interface displaying real-time data from ML-based AML monitoring and risk scoring systems. Biometric authentication features are currently disabled.
-   **Internal API Documentation**: A comprehensive list of all internal API endpoints and their communication flow has been provided.
-   **User Experience Workflow**: A detailed and user-friendly workflow, including the newly requested Micro Loans and IBAN verification during registration, has been outlined.

The user's most recent interaction is a request to further refine Phase 3 (Open Banking) to ensure all API calls are dependent on  and include the  header, with specific customer data provided for context.
